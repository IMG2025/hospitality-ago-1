- Findings: HIGH=4, MEDIUM=3, LOW=2 (data_quality counted as LOW)
- Top Domains: loss_prevention(6, max=high), email_intrusion(3, max=high)

### Recommended Next Steps
- Initiate same-day human review of HIGH findings and preserve evidence.

## Findings (9)
- **HIGH** [email_intrusion] Policy match: email_forwarding_rule_created — _event_type=rule_created, detail=forward rule created, actor=user1, ip=1.1.1.1, geo=US, timestamp=2026-01-23T01:00:00Z_ | rec: Review mailbox forwarding and inbox rules immediately.; Force password reset for affected account(s).; Review OAuth grants and recent sign-in activity.; Preserve logs and artifacts for incident response.
- **HIGH** [email_intrusion] Policy match: email_forwarding_rule_created — _event_type=rule_modified, detail=forward rule modified, actor=user1, ip=1.1.1.1, geo=US, timestamp=2026-01-23T01:10:00Z_ | rec: Review mailbox forwarding and inbox rules immediately.; Force password reset for affected account(s).; Review OAuth grants and recent sign-in activity.; Preserve logs and artifacts for incident response.
- **HIGH** [email_intrusion] Repeated email security events for actor 'user1' within 15 minutes | rec: Review mailbox forwarding and inbox rules immediately.; Force password reset for affected account(s).; Review OAuth grants and recent sign-in activity.; Preserve logs and artifacts for incident response.
- **MEDIUM** [loss_prevention] Inventory variance spike detected (>= $250) — _business_date=2026-01-20, location_id=LOC1, sku=VODKA750, variance_value=300, variance_qty=-3, notes=variance spike_ | rec: Review variance drivers (waste, spoilage, comps) for affected SKU/location/date.; Spot-check receiving and storage controls for affected SKU(s).
- **MEDIUM** [loss_prevention] Inventory variance spike detected (>= $250) — _business_date=2026-01-22, location_id=LOC1, sku=VODKA750, variance_value=420, variance_qty=-4, notes=repeat spike_ | rec: Review variance drivers (waste, spoilage, comps) for affected SKU/location/date.; Spot-check receiving and storage controls for affected SKU(s).
- **MEDIUM** [loss_prevention] Inventory variance spike detected (>= $250) — _business_date=2026-01-23, location_id=LOC2, sku=BEEF5LB, variance_value=260, variance_qty=-5, notes=spike_ | rec: Review variance drivers (waste, spoilage, comps) for affected SKU/location/date.; Spot-check receiving and storage controls for affected SKU(s).
- **HIGH** [loss_prevention] Repeat variance pattern: 2 spikes in last 7 days (location=LOC1, sku=VODKA750) — _location_id=LOC1, sku=VODKA750, spike_count=2, total_variance_value=720_ | rec: Validate inventory counts and receiving records for affected SKU/location/date.; Review waste/comp/void logs for the same period (no individual attribution).; Confirm vendor deliveries and invoice quantities; check for unit-of-measure mismatches.; Increase cycle counts for affected SKU(s) for the next 7 days.
- **LOW** [loss_prevention] Hotspot SKUs by total variance value (top 5) — _sku_1=VODKA750 ($720), sku_2=BEEF5LB ($380), sku_3=LIME ($90)_ | rec: Monitor variance trends and confirm data coverage.
- **LOW** [loss_prevention] Hotspot locations by total variance value (top 5) — _location_1=LOC1 ($810), location_2=LOC2 ($380)_ | rec: Monitor variance trends and confirm data coverage.
