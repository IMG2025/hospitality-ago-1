## Executive Summary
- Risk Score: **99/100** (**CRITICAL**)
- Findings: HIGH=8, MEDIUM=3, LOW=4 (data_quality counted as LOW)
- Top Domains: loss_prevention(6, max=high), facility_maintenance(5, max=high), email_intrusion(3, max=high)

### Recommended Next Steps
- Initiate same-day human review of HIGH findings and preserve evidence.
- Address data gaps flagged under data_quality to improve assessment accuracy.
